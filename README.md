Spam Filter

This script builds and trains an LSTM-based model for classifying messages as either "ham" or "spam" using TensorFlow and Keras. The model leverages sequence padding and a tokenizer to handle variable-length text inputs. It incorporates best practices like data splitting and visualization of training progress, enhancing model robustness and interpretability. The core technique utilizes LSTM networks for sequential data analysis, alongside techniques like embedding and max pooling to extract salient features from the text.
